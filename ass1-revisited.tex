\section{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} Introduction}
\label{sec:org529328d}
\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sec:org20fb081}
This document presents a design aimed at reducing waste, caused by
a university cafeteria over-producing food, by using a pre-ordering
service along with historical analysis to provide accurate
short-term demand estimates as well as insight into overall trends.

\subsection{{\bfseries\sffamily DONE} Usage Scenarios}
\label{sec:orgd13d316}
\subsubsection{Student Case}
\label{sec:orgaf953c4}
Frank and Giorgia are sitting in class taking notes on their
laptops. They want to eat at the Cafeteria before their next
lecture. The University Cafeteria has a wide variety of food
available, and Frank is hungry so he looks up the Cafeteria's menu
and decides to get fish and chips with a side of salad. Giorgia
does the same, but also places an order and schedules to pick it
up in thirty minutes.

Frank and Giorgia leave class and go the Cafeteria. When they
arrive Frank looks around for his desired meal, but does not see
it. Another batch of fish and chips is being made and he'll have
to wait or choose something else. 

Giorgia instead goes to a kiosk labeled "Pick-up" and tells the
clerk her name and order number. The clerk fetches her meal, and
she goes to pay the cashier.
\subsubsection{Cafeteria Case}
\label{sec:orgf8b7769}
At the beginning of a new day cooks in the Cafeteria begin
preparing that day's meals. For the most part they stick to a
routine menu with items appearing on and disappearing from the
menu at regular intervals for various reasons. Whether because of
shortage or to keep the menu fresh. This is the core menu.

They also prepare some meals that have already been ordered for
the morning. Which are placed in temporary storage, organized for
quick retrieval and preserved to keep the hot and cold items
fresh. Students come and go picking up their orders, or taking
time choosing a meal. Some 

The kitchen notices that a particular item is selling less than
usual and by the end of the day there looks to be an excess amount
of waste. The kitchen signals to the computer system that it
should promote this item in some way. Either through a banner in
the app, placing the item nearer to the top of the menu, putting
on a token sale of the item, or whatever other promotional
method.

At the end of the month the kitchen notices that some items were
unpopular based off of the sales statistics. The kitchen then
decides that they will take those items off the menu, or make less
for the next month.
\subsection{{\bfseries\sffamily DONE} Participants}
\label{sec:org72a9f7d}
\subsubsection{Stakeholders}
\label{sec:org525f340}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{University}
\label{sec:org69ce2aa}

The university will provide a preordering service for students
and a notification service for the Cafeteria, informing it of
students' orders.

Additionally the University will be recording transactions made
through the preorder service (and those made without it) so that
the data may later be analyzed.

\item \textbf{Digital Payment Processor}
\label{sec:orgeb63209}

A Digital Payment Processing company provides exactly such a
service, processing pre-order payments made through an online
service.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Users}
\label{sec:org4b657c3}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Cafeteria}
\label{sec:orgdcb43b9}

The Cafeteria serves food to Students, receiving orders directly
from a student or indirectly via the University's
preorder/notification service. The Cafeteria will also report
sales and unsold product. The Cafeteria produces the supply.

\item {\bfseries\sffamily DONE} \textbf{Students}
\label{sec:orge5c79e8}

A Student of the University is a customer of the
Cafeteria. Students are the entities which generate demand.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{{\bfseries\sffamily DONE} Model}
\label{sec:org62d4191}

\subsection{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} Conceptual Services}
\label{sec:orgf8fad10}
This section contains a list of every service that could be related
to the operation of the proposed system. In it are both software
and non-software services, we will describe the details of some of
the former and assume the latter will be provided by other
entities.
\subsubsection*{Preorder Service\hfill{}\textsc{hybrid}}
\label{sec:orgfc87897}
The service by which Students can communicate their demand ahead
of time.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Authorization Service}\hfill{}\textsc{utility}
\label{sec:orgb005b35}

Provided by the University for the Students, Cafeteria, and
University Administrators. Serves as a secure gateway for
accessing software components of the system.

\begin{itemize}
\item Registration Service\hfill{}\textsc{utility}
\label{sec:orgfc3b00d}
\item Login Service\hfill{}\textsc{utility}
\label{sec:org6473ee3}
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Online Ordering Service}\hfill{}\textsc{hybrid}
\label{sec:org8747433}

Cafeteria of what orders have been placed, the contents of the
order and the desired pickup time.

\item \textbf{Digital Payment Service}\hfill{}\textsc{utility}
\label{sec:orgc58eda5}

Provided by the Digital Bank stakeholder, if the Student wishes
to pay at the time of preordering, they are transferred to the
Digital Bank's service in order to complete the payment.

\item \textbf{Food Service}\hfill{}\textsc{task}
\label{sec:org33b9d83}

Non-software service provided the Cafeteria, performing manual
labor required to complete orders.

\begin{itemize}
\item Food Preparation Service\hfill{}\textsc{task}
\label{sec:orgfd8ead6}

Fulfillment of Student orders.

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Prediction Service\hfill{}\textsc{hybrid}}
\label{sec:orgbed4167}
The service by which a prediction of demand in the short and long
term is made.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Analysis Service}\hfill{}\textsc{entity}

service or collects data regarding the other sales made at the
Cafeteria.

\begin{itemize}
\item Reporting Service\hfill{}\textsc{utility}
\label{sec:org03016ec}

Provided for the Cafeteria by the University. The Cafeteria
reports sales made, preorders fulfilled, and excess production.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Data Storage Service}\hfill{}\textsc{task}
\label{sec:org0324616}

The data the University collects on orders needs to be stored
somewhere, whether this is done on an owned asset or if though a
service provided by another stakeholder.

\item \textbf{(Data) Viewing Service}\hfill{}\textsc{entity}
\label{sec:org956f6eb}

The data which has been stored must be accessible for the
University to perform analysis.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Menu Changing Service\hfill{}\textsc{task}}
\label{sec:orge7a7a0c}
The Cafeteria has to be able to change the menu from week to week,
or over whatever time period the menu changes.

\subsubsection{View Service\hfill{}\textsc{entity}}
\label{sec:orgef1408d}
\section{{\bfseries\sffamily DONE} Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:orgce0c1e3}

In this section we list some of the functional requirements that our
services, as they are described, must fulfill. They have been
derived from the services outlined in the \hyperref[sec:orgf8fad10]{Conceptual Services}
section. The format is:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{ID : \emph{Name}}

Short Description
\end{itemize}

For our purposes we will select functional requirements most
relevant to the problem of accurately predicting demand. To this end
we will be concerned with \hyperref[orga25b036]{FR-01} (\emph{Placing Orders}), \hyperref[org248432e]{FR-04} (\emph{Record
Transactions}), and \hyperref[orge355598]{FR-08} (\emph{Trend Analysis}). These three functions
form a skeleton of the proposed service: when a Student places an
order, that data is collected by the University and saved for future
analysis. This means we will neglecting the Digital Bank
stakeholder, and perhaps only touching the actions of the
Cafeteria. The other functionalities listed are necessary but
peripheral to the core intent of this proposal.

\newpage
\subsection*{\emph{Requirements}}
\label{sec:org5f6e8ed}
\subsubsection*{* \label{orga25b036}FR-01 : \emph{Placing Orders}}
\label{sec:org19dc9fa}
A Student must be able to place an order without being physically
present at the Cafeteria
\subsubsection*{\label{org97be6c0}FR-02 : \emph{Schedule Pickup}}
\label{sec:org2ed6ca3}
As an order is placed, the Student should also be able to specify
a time they wish to obtain their order.
\subsubsection*{\label{org31fa9b7}FR-03 : \emph{Electronic Payment}}
\label{sec:orgfbd6269}
A Student should be able to optionally pay at the time of placing
their order.
\subsubsection*{* \label{org248432e}FR-04 : \emph{Record Transactions}}
\label{sec:org9c4f61a}
Each transaction made must be recorded.
\subsubsection*{\label{orgd1b159b}FR-05 : \emph{Send Transactions Records}}
\label{sec:orgd211819}
If a transaction is not made through the preorder system, the
Cafeteria must still report it to the University.
\subsubsection*{\label{orgbd5ff54}FR-06 : \emph{Send Cafeteria Orders}}
\label{sec:orgb46e390}
There must be a system in place so that the Cafeteria receives
preorders as soon as possible.
\subsubsection*{\label{org1629830}FR-07 : \emph{Authorization}}
\label{sec:org0dfeb96}
The system must be properly secured so that users of the system
may register, log in, and perform whatever actions that particular
user is permitted and no others.
\subsubsection*{* \label{orge355598}FR-08 : \emph{Trend Analysis}}
\label{sec:orga9ed415}
The system must have some way of extrapolating demand based on the
number of preorders, correlated with historical data.

\section{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} Quality Requirements}
\label{sec:orgc82863c}

This section will discuss the most important qualities in
considering the problem of more accurately predicting and meeting
demand. For clarity we will use standard\footnote{ISO/IEC 25010:2011} definitions.

\subsection{{\bfseries\sffamily DONE} \label{org26e6952}QR-01 : \emph{Security}}
\label{sec:orga5a5cc8}
\begin{description}
\item[{Definition}] degree to which a product or system protects
information and data so that persons or other
products or systems have the degree of data access
appropriate to their types and levels of
authorization
\end{description}


We choose security because adoption of the system is predicated on
security. If the system is not secure and leaks important
information, or is otherwise compromised, trust in the system will
diminish to nothing. Any security faults regarding the online
payment process would be especially deleterious.
\subsection{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} \label{org9567a82}QR-02 : \emph{Availability}}
\label{sec:orgb1f586e}
\begin{description}
\item[{Definition}] degree to which a system, product or component is
operational and accessible when required for use
\end{description}


The system must be reliably available to users on campus and off,
with as little down-time as possible. The end users rely on the
preorder service to order food ahead of time, and the University
relies on it to develop a model for demand

\subsection{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} \label{orgbc51223}QR-03 : \emph{Usability}}
\label{sec:org0d3639e}
\begin{itemize}
\item Note taken on \textit{[2018-10-11 Thu 11:40] } \\
Update motivation
\item[{Definition}] degree to which a product or system can be used by
specified users to achieve specified goals with
effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a
specified context of use
\end{itemize}


The students will want to be able to use the services quickly and
easily, because they only need to browse through the menu and place
an order, regardless of the device. If the service is too complex
to use they will not make pre-ordering a habit which contradicts
our goal of

\subsection{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} \label{org1d355e4}QR-04 : \emph{Reliability}}

performs specified functions under specified
conditions for a specified period of time

\subsubsection*{Concern}
\label{sec:orgc9636cd}
\begin{description}
\item[{Con\#1}] How can the user be encouraged to use the pre-ordering
system? Are there any barriers or concerns that the
customer or business would have that would make them
not want to use it, undercutting the primary goal of
reducing waste via this system?

\subsubsection*{Criteria}
\label{sec:org92e680a}
\begin{description}
\item[{Cr\#1}] Security
\item[{Cr\#2}] Availability
\item[{Cr\#3}] Reliability
\end{description}
\subsubsection*{Options}
\label{sec:org34ec2f8}
\begin{itemize}
\item Trusted Third Party Payment
\label{sec:orgb082640}
\begin{description}
\item[{ID}] Con\#1-Opt\#1
\item[{Description}] Pre-order payment should be done through a
trusted and known third party with experience so
the process is secure.
\item[{Status}] Decided
\item[{Relationship(s)}] none
\item[{Evaluation}] ---
\begin{itemize}
\item Cr\#1 --- This option is secure as long as the
third party maintains integrity. While we have a little less
control over the security of the system, a third-party
payment processing company's business is predicated on
security, so we assess this positively.
\item Cr\#2 --- This option's availability depends again on the
third party, it is partially out of our control, depending on
the service model of the third party.
\item Cr\#3 --- This option should be reliable since we are only one
client of the Digital Bank, it is important for
them for their service to be reliable
\end{itemize}
\item[{Rationale}] Given that the third-party processing company is
of repute, this option should have the best
security, availability, and usability. The same
functionality is achieved as implementing it
in-house but with a slight recurring cost.
\end{description}
\item Payment on Pickup
\label{sec:org702c86d}
\begin{description}
\item[{ID}] Con\#1-Opt\#2
\item[{Description}] There is no online payment system, the customer
pays for items upon receipt.
\item[{Status}] Rejected
\item[{Relationship(s)}] none
\item[{Evaluation}] ---
\begin{itemize}
\item Cr\#1 --- This option is as secure as the Cafeteria itself. No
additional attack vectors are added to the existing
infrastructure.
\item Cr\#2 --- The rest of the system may still have high
availability, but this option does not improve on
availability with respect to payment.
\item Cr\#3 ---
