** Participants
   
*** Stakeholders
**** *University*

     The university will provide a preordering service for students
     and a notification service for the Cafeteria, informing it of
     students' orders.

     Additionally the University will be recording transactions made
     through the preorder service (and those made without it) so that
     the data may later be analyzed.

**** *Digital Payment Processor*

     A Digital Payment Processing company provides exactly such a
     service, processing pre-order payments made through an online
     service.

*** Users
**** *Cafeteria*

     The Cafeteria serves food to Students, receiving orders directly
     from a student or indirectly via the University's
     preorder/notification service. The Cafeteria will also report
     sales and unsold product. The Cafeteria produces the supply.

**** *Students*

     A Student of the University is a customer of the
     Cafeteria. Students are the entities which generate demand.
