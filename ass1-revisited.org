* Introduction
** Purpose
   This document presents a design aimed at reducing waste, caused by
   a university cafeteria over-producing food, by using a pre-ordering
   service along with historical analysis to provide accurate
   short-term demand estimates as well as insight into overall trends.

** Participants
   
*** Stakeholders
**** *University*

     The university will provide a preordering service for students
     and a notification service for the Cafeteria, informing it of
     students' orders.

     Additionally the University will be recording transactions made
     through the preorder service (and those made without it) so that
     the data may later be analyzed.

**** *Digital Payment Processor*

     A Digital Payment Processing company provides exactly such a
     service, processing pre-order payments made through an online
     service.

*** Users
**** *Cafeteria*

     The Cafeteria serves food to Students, receiving orders directly
     from a student or indirectly via the University's
     preorder/notification service. The Cafeteria will also report
     sales and unsold product. The Cafeteria produces the supply.

**** *Students*

     A Student of the University is a customer of the
     Cafeteria. Students are the entities which generate demand.

** Conceptual Services
*** Preorder Service                                                 :hybrid:
    The service by which Students can communicate their demand ahead
    of time.
**** *Authorization Service*                                        :utility:

     Provided by the University for the Students, Cafeteria, and
     University Administrators. Serves as a secure gateway for
     accessing software components of the system.

***** Registration Service                                          :utility:

**** *Online Ordering Service*                                       :hybrid:

     Provided by the University for the Students. An internet gateway
     Students use to interact with the system.

***** Menu Viewing Service                                           :entity:
***** Shopping Cart Service                                          :entity:
***** Scheduling Service                                               :task:
**** *Notification Service*                                            :task:

     Provided by the University to the Cafeteria. Informs the
     Cafeteria of what orders have been placed, the contents of the
     order and the desired pickup time.

**** *Digital Payment Service*                                      :utility:

     Provided by the Digital Bank stakeholder, if the Student wishes
     to pay at the time of preordering, they are transferred to the
     Digital Bank's service in order to complete the payment.

**** *Food Service*                                                    :task:

*** Prediction Service                                               :hybrid:
    The service by which a prediction of demand in the short and long
    term is made.
**** *Analysis Service*                                              :entity:

     Owned by the University. Analyzes collected data in order to
     develop a model for future demand.

**** *Record Service*                                                  :task:

     Owned by the University. Records orders made through the preorder
     service or collects data regarding the other sales made at the
     Cafeteria.

    The Cafeteria has to be able to change the menu from week to week,
    or over whatever time period the menu changes.
* Functional Requirements

  In this section we list some of the functional requirements that our
  services, as they are described, must fulfill. They have been
  derived from the services outlined in the [[*Conceptual Services][Conceptual Services]]
  section. The format is:

  + ID :: /Name/ --- Short Description

  For our purposes we will select functional requirements most
  pertinent to the problem of accurately predicting demand. To this
  end we will be concerned with FR-01 (/Placing Orders/), FR-04
  (/Record Transactions/), and FR-08 (/Trend Analysis/). These three
  functions form a skeleton of the proposed service: when a Student
  places an order, that data is collected and saved for future
  analysis. This means we will neglecting the Digital Bank
  stakeholder, and perhaps only touching the actions of the Cafeteria.

  --------
** /Requirements/
   :PROPERTIES:
   :UNNUMBERED: t
   :END:
*** <<<FR-01>>>
    /Placing Orders/ --- A Student must be able to place an order
    without being physically present at the Cafeteria
*** FR-02
    /Schedule Pickup/ --- As an order is placed, the Student should
    also be able to specify a time they wish to obtain their order.
*** FR-03
    /Electronic Payment/ --- A Student should be able to optionally
    pay at the time of placing their order.
*** <<<FR-04>>>
    /Record Transactions/ --- Each transaction made must be recorded.
*** FR-05
    /Send Transactions Records/ --- If a transaction is not made
    through the preorder system, the Cafeteria must still report it to
    the University.
*** FR-06
    /Send Cafeteria Orders/ --- There must be a system in place so
    that the Cafeteria receives preorders as soon as possible.
*** FR-07
    /Authorization/ --- The system must be properly secured so that
    users of the system may register, log in, and perform whatever
    actions that particular user is permitted and no others.
*** <<<FR-08>>>
    /Trend Analysis/ --- The system must have some way of
    extrapolating demand based on the number of preorders, correlated
    with historical data.
