#+AUTHOR: Jacob Sonnenberg
* Introduction
** Purpose
   This document presents a design aimed at reducing waste, caused by
   a university cafeteria over-producing food, by using a pre-ordering
   service along with historical analysis to provide accurate
   short-term demand estimates as well as insight into overall trends.

** Participants
   
*** Stakeholders
**** *University ::*
     The university will provide a preordering service for students
     and a notification service for the Cafeteria, informing it of
     students' orders.

     Additionally the University will be recording transactions made
     through the preorder service (and those made without it) so that
     the data may later be analyzed.
**** *Digital Payment Processor ::*
     A Digital Payment Processing company provides exactly such a
     service, processing pre-order payments made through an online
     service.
*** Users
**** *Cafeteria ::*
     The Cafeteria serves food to Students, receiving orders directly
     from a student or indirectly via the University's preorder
     service. The Cafeteria produces the supply.
**** *Students ::*
     A Student of the University is a customer of the
     Cafeteria. Students generate demand.
** Potential Services
*** Preorder Service
    The service by which Students can communicate their demand ahead
    of time.
**** *Authorization Service ::*
     Provided by the University for the Students, Cafeteria, and
     University Administrators. Serves as a security gateway for
     accessing software components of the system.
**** *Online Ordering Service ::*
     Provided by the University for the Students. An internet gateway
     Students use to interact with the system.
**** *Notification Service ::*
     Provided by the University to the Cafeteria. Informs the
     Cafeteria of what orders have been placed, the contents of the
     order and the desired pickup time.
**** *Digital Payment Service ::*
     Provided by the Digital Bank stakeholder, if the Student pays at
     the time of preordering, they are transferred to the Digital
     Bank's service in order to complete the payment.
**** *Service Service ::*
     Non-software service provided the Cafeteria, performing food
     preparation and acting as the point of sale.
*** Prediction Service
    The service by which a prediction of demand in the short and long
    term is made.
**** *Analysis Service ::*
     Owned by the University
**** *Record Service ::*
     Owned by the University. Records orders made through the preorder
     service as well as local sales made by the cafeteria, either
     automatically or manually updated.
